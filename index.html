				Large language models (LLMs) and autonomous coding agents
are increasingly involved in software maintenance tasks, including
code refactoring. Among these, code clone removal is well suited for
automation. However, little is known about how AI agents actually
perform clone refactoring in real-world development workflows
compared to human developers. This paper presents an empirical
study of 117 clone-related pull requests (PRs) collected from the
AIDev dataset, equally divided into three groups: (1) PRs created
and written by humans, (2) PRs created by humans but generated by
agents, and (3) PRs created and written entirely by agents. Our quan-
titative analysis shows that agent-involved PRs are completed up
to 20√ó faster (median closure time 0.9 vs. 19.4 hours; ùõø = 0.40‚Äì0.63,
p < 0.001), with 50‚Äì70% smaller change sizes (median churn 72
vs. 198 lines) and 30‚Äì55% lower reviewer workload. Qualitative
analysis further reveals that 46.2% of agent PRs exhibit comprehen-
sive structure and explicit scope definition, improving readability
and review efficiency. In contrast, human PRs demonstrate richer
explanatory depth (33% explanatory vs. 10% in hybrid PRs) and
more proactive self-correction, though at higher cost in time and
review effort. Across human PRs, there exists 5 cases that identified
clones but did not perform concrete refactoring actions. For curated
PRs, we also identified 2 such cases for human created but agent
generated PRs and 1 such case for purely agent PRs. Among all
PRs, none explicitly mentioned clone types such as Type-1 or Type-2 in title,
description or inline comments.Overall, our findings indicate that AI agents are highly effective for clone refactoring tasks requiring precision and speed, but
they still rely on human oversight for architectural alignment, and
sustainable system design.
